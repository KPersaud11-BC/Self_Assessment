# Self_Assessment by Kieran Persaud

## Summary of Project
Our project sought to determine the effect of macroeconomic factors on stock exchange index closing prices. The question we asked is could we determine the stock price of any particular time based on the relationship of inflation, GDP, and working population? We utilized a supervised machine learning model that performed multivariate linear regression. After training our model with historical data, we determined the following equation that would predict closing prices with a 94.57% accuracy.

```Pred Close Price = (0.19632 x Pred Real GDP per Capita) + (2653.9 x Pred Inflation) + (0.000018474 x Pred Working Pop)- 13234.04```

## Self Assessment
Presents a cohesive written analysis that describes the role(s) they played over the course of the project and their contribution to the project in that role. 

For this project, I assumed the role that worked on the machine learning model. I thoroughly enjoyed this lesson during the course and wanted to do more work with the topic. In this project, I identified the type of model that would be used, built the necessary code in a Google Colab notebook, tested and trained the datasets, and determined its accuracy in solving the question the group posed. As previously mentioned, the model was able to achieve a 94.57% accuracy, which exceeded our initial goal of 75% accuracy.


Presents a cohesive written summary of how they contributed to each of the roles they did not take on via team discussions, peer reviews, or other means. 

While my main focus was the machine learning model, I was very participatory in the other roles. In the beginning stages, I provided sources for possible datasets that the group could analyze, and that the Database team could process. Throughout the project, I was available to answer questions via Slack, and reviewed the GitHub to clear any discrepancies and issues with merging the branches with the main. After determining the equation used to calculate predicted closing prices, I worked with the Visualization team to graph the historical data vs the predicted data, which they then depicted in Tableau.

Additionally, the analysis should describe their greatest personal challenge over the course of the project, and how they overcame that challenge.

The greatest personal challenge that I had to overcome during the project was the forethought and planning that had to go into the Machine Learning Model. I had to critically think about the target and feature sets, how the model would answer the question, and if the data we found served as adequate inputs. I was able to overcome it through time management and breaking up the deliverables into small tasks to accomplish. My personal success was also facilitated by the team structure, which I will discuss in the next section.

## Team Assessment 
Presents a cohesive written analysis that describes their teamwork, including all of the following: 

✓ Their communication protocol, including any challenges, how they were resolved, and what they would do differently next time 

✓ Their strengths as a team, including tips and tricks they would want to share with a new cohort kicking off the project
