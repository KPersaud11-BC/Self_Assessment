# Self_Assessment by Kieran Persaud

## Summary of Project
Presents a cohesive, three- to four-sentence summary of the project that could be used on a LinkedIn profile, in an interview or cover letter, or as an elevator pitch, including all of the following: ✓ Topic addressed ✓ Machine module used ✓ Results of the analysis

Our project sought to determine the effect of macroeconomic factors on stock exchange index closing prices. The question we asked is could we determine the stock price of any particular time based on the relationship of inflation, GDP, and working population? We utilized a supervised machine learning model that performed multivariate linear regression. After training our model with historical data, we determined the following equation that would predict closing prices with a 94.57% accuracy.

```Pred Close Price = (0.19632 x Pred Real GDP per Capita) + (2653.9 x Pred Inflation) + (0.000018474 x Pred Working Pop)- 13234.04```

## Self Assessment
Presents a cohesive written analysis that describes the role(s) they played over the course of the project and their contribution to the project in that role. Presents a cohesive written summary of how they contributed to each of the roles they did not take on via team discussions, peer reviews, or other means. Additionally, the analysis should describe their greatest personal challenge over the course of the project, and how they overcame that challenge.

## Team Assessment 
Presents a cohesive written analysis that describes their teamwork, including all of the following: ✓ Their communication protocol, including any challenges, how they were resolved, and what they would do differently next time ✓ Their strengths as a team, including tips and tricks they would want to share with a new cohort kicking off the project
